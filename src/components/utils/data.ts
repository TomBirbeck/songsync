        song: 'Johnny B. Goode', 
        lyrics: 
        `Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
        Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
        There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
        Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
        Who never ever learned to read or write so well
        But he could play the guitar just a-ringin' a bell
        Go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Johnny B. Goode
        He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
        Go sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
        Oh, the engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
        Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
        People passing by, they would stop and say
        "Oh my, but that little country boy could play"
        Go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Go, Johnny, go, go
        Johnny B. Goode
        His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man
        And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
        Many people coming from miles around
        To hear you play your music when the sun go down
        Maybe someday your name will be in lights
        Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"
        Go, go
        Go, Johnny, go
        Go, go, go, Johnny, go
        Go, go, go, Johnny, go
        Go, go, go, Johnny, go
        Go
        Johnny B. Goode`

        Don't ask me, I'll never tell
        I looked to you as it fell
        And now you're in my way
        I trade my soul for a wish
        Pennies and dimes for a kiss
        I wasn't looking for this

        Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
        Hot night, wind was blowin'
        Where you think you're going, baby?
        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
        But here's my number, so call me, maybe
        It's hard to look right at you, baby
        But here's my number, so call me, maybe
        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
        But here's my number, so call me, maybe

        But here's my number, so call me, maybe
        You took your time with the call
        I took no time with the fall
        You gave me nothing at all

        I beg and borrow and steal
        At first sight, and it's real
        I didn't know I would feel it

        Aww yeah, Vanilla Ice is in the place
        I'm here to tell ya a little story 'bout my 5.0
        Just a-lettin' ya know, I'm in total control
        Oh yes many people know that I got good taste
        And if the cops try to race in a high speed chase
        I just laugh, right in their face and say YO,
        Don't even waste your time, see,
        'Cause I can red-line and leave you far behind
        Because I'm out gettin' mine
        And I'm sweatin' like steam and you can feel the flow
        When I'm Rollin' in my 5.0
        Rollin' in my 5.0...
        It's not a Benz or a Jag, if a 5-0 with a rag
        And I don't wanna brag, but I could never be stag
        When I'm cruisin', to A-1-A
        Zero to 60, 4 seconds don't play
        This ain't no joke, and you can see the smoke
        I'm burnin' rubba
        You heard me clear I didn't stutta
        The V-I-P Posse, with my homeboy Staff
        And you can giggle and chuckle, but I'll have the last,
        Laugh and take my money all the way to the bank
        And the ones that buy my records are the ones I should thank
        Cause I'm sweatin' like steam and you can feel the flow
        When I'm rollin, in my 5.0
        Rollin' in my 5.0...
        I view a fly cutie and I wanna converse
        I shift to first, and then back to reverse
        'Cause there's crazy fly ronis at NNB
        They wanna flee with the I-C-E
        I don't drive 55 when I'm in my ride, I just glide
        My head leaned to the side.
        I cruise the A-1-A with a plan in mind
        The V-I-P Posse not far behind
        The honeys top and jump for my thousand watts
        If fills the back seat as my system rocks
        'Cause I'm sweatin like steam and you can feel the flow
        When I'm rollin, in my 5.0`
